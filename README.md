== CONTRIBUTE CODE

So here's a confession; this is my first ROR app that is going to have actual useful gems in it and not be a complete joke and will actually deploy beyond Heroku. So any help I can get will be appreciated. If you want contribute code or offer tipcs, feel free to fork the code thats here and make pull requests. I'm more than open to criticism and ridcule when it comes my code.
